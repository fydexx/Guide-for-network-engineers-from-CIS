# English language

**Key considerations**

- English language is the biggest problem for network engineers from CIS.
- People can often listen and read, but struggle with verbal and writing skills.
- You must improve your English every day. There is no other way. 
- Spend at least 1 hour a day to practice English.

---

**Study with a teacher**

The best way is to study with a native speaker, but for a start non-native speakers are good too.

You can find native speaking teachers here:
https://www.italki.com/home

Non-native (they are more cheaper of course):

**Divide your study plan to parts.**

- Vocabulary and Grammar
- Listening
- Speaking and Pronunciation
- Writing
- Reading

**Study all parts daily**

Learn every day at least 10-20 new words.
